# UReserve
Jordan Brown, (Luba) Xuan Thuong Le, Tarin Rickett, Yoonsie Kim

## Target Audience
The target audience for UReserve are student organizations, teaching assistants, professors, and individual students. Student organizations need to reserve specific rooms for events and meetings. Additionally, student organizations have specific requirements that their rooms need to meet (time slot, maximum number of students, etc.). The school needs to reserve rooms for events and get priority over student reservations. Professors often need to make reservations for teaching assistants. And lastly, individual students usually want to reserve rooms for study sessions with their peers and working on group projects. 

## Problem
We are offering a simpler, more user friendly version of Virtual EMS, the University of Rochester’s current room reservation system. 
* Only one designated member of a club can reserve rooms for an organization, which makes it difficult when members leave a club
* Separate tabs for browsing rooms and reserving them
* Pop up windows for rooms are too small to check its availability, requiring scrolling
* The input time box in the reservations tab doesn’t work, and once a request is submitted, there is no verification of reservation
* Error messages are hard to interpret  
* Most of the information on EMS is redundant and repetitive
* Virtual EMS is so user-unfriendly and unintuitive that there is a User Manual Guide tab with information on how to use website

## Requirements
* Technologies: Apache, MySQL, PHP, AJAX, JSON, python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
* Users will be required to create accounts in order to make reservations
* Real-time data of rooms available for reservation will be readable by visitors to the site
* Users can update their reservation information— changing details, cancelling, or adding
* Users may also delete reservations and also their account

## Beyond
In addition to meeting the CRUD application requirements, we will add a function of interactivity and user-friendliness by creating a vector image map of the campus building written in JavaScript. It will be clickable for the user to pick or browse rooms to reserve.  We also plan to use modern APIs such as Google Maps, a Web 3.0 feature.
